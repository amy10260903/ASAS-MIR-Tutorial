## Installation

Before doing homework, please install the packages below.

* Python (or Anaconda)
* Librosa 
* Madmom  

## Homework

### Q1 : Beat Tracking [link](https://github.com/jkang3322/ASAS-MIR-Tutorial/blob/master/beat_tracking/beat_track_hw.ipynb)

1. Try to use functions which are from librosa and madmam to implement the beat-tracking with 3 audio files 
2. Write some comments (what is the principle of each step) to the beat tracking part of your code. 

### Q2 : Chord Detection (Madmom)

1. Briefly describe the algorithm of chord detection in madmom.	
2. Use one of your own music wave file (30 s) and run the chord detection. What's the results? Please give some discussion on the results. [link](https://github.com/jkang3322/ASAS-MIR-Tutorial/blob/master/Chord_Detection/chord.py)

### Submission

Please put the files (wave files, code, pdf) into a folder and submit to ilms.

1. Q1 : Three audio files(mentioned in Mission: 1) with clicks and two source codes with some comments (mentioned in Mission: 2), optimizations can also be done.
2. Q2 : Your own music wave file and discussion
